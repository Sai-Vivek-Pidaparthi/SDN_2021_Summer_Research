# SDN 2021 Summer Research
## Introduction
This is the repository for my research for the NC4 internship. The focus of the research is on developing resilience on SDN controlled networks. This repository includes the SDN controller code used in the research, the BFD script used with Mininet switches and scripts to help configure test enviroments.

## Original Proposed To-Do List
* Phase 1 (Completed): In this phase, you need to learn how to use ONOS as the control plane for a software-defined network.
* Phase 2 (Completed): You will use mininet and run with multiple SDN controllers. the SDN controllers must coordinate with each other to achieve this communication and ensure their availability during path failures.
* Phase 3: Move the test environment from mininet to a real cluster
