# ONOS_Multi_Controller
## Order of when features will be implemented
* Phase 1: In this phase, you need to learn how to use ONOS as the control plane for a software-defined network.
* Phase 2: You will use mininet and run with multiple SDN controllers. the SDN controllers must coordinate with each other to achieve this communication and ensure their availability during path failures.
* Phase 3: Move the test environment from mininet to a real cluster
